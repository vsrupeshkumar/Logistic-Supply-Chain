# Logistic Supply Chain Engine

**A deterministic, multi-agent, real-time autonomous routing simulation platform for dense urban logistics networks.**

Built on a hybrid architecture of a high-frequency discrete-time physics engine, graph-based optimal path selection, and LLM-driven agent decision reasoning — operating continuously against live Bangalore traffic data.

## System Architecture

The platform is structured as a layered system. The presentation layer communicates exclusively through REST contracts with the backend logic layer. The simulation engine operates independently of the HTTP request cycle and persists its state to an embedded relational store.

## Simulation Engine

The engine runs as a singleton server-side process at **3.3 Hz** (one tick every 300 ms). Each tick applies physical constraints, advances positions along OSRM-resolved waypoint graphs, evaluates AI agent decisions, and persists the resulting state to the SQLite store.

A mutex semaphore prevents tick pile-up under compute saturation:

    SNAP2 --> RELEASE
    WRITE --> RELEASE[Release Lock]
```

### Positional Advancement per Tick

Given vehicle class-based velocity $V_{base}$, a congestion coefficient $C_d \in [0, 1]$, and a time-scale multiplier $S$:

$$D_{tick} = V_{base} \cdot C_d \cdot \frac{\Delta t}{3600} \cdot S$$

Where $\Delta t = 0.3$ seconds and $S = 8$ (simulation speed scale). The result $D_{tick}$ is the distance in kilometers the agent must traverse per tick. The engine iterates the OSRM waypoint graph, consuming this budget across sequential arc segments.

---

## Agent State Machine

Each vehicle agent is governed by a five-state deterministic finite automaton. Transitions are triggered either by explicit operator commands from the Fleet Command Console or by autonomous decisions from the LLM sub-agent layer.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> idle: Vehicle Created

    idle --> in_transit: Deploy Command
    in_transit --> idle: Halt Command
    in_transit --> maintenance: Maintenance Command
    in_transit --> refueling: Refuel Command OR Fuel Below Threshold
    maintenance --> in_transit: Redeploy Command
    refueling --> in_transit: Arrival at Station - Tank Filled
```

### State-to-Facility Binding Rules

| State | Physical Constraint | Destination |
|---|---|---|
| `idle` | Snapped to nearest warehouse | Nearest logistics hub |
| `maintenance` | Snapped to nearest warehouse | Nearest logistics hub |
| `refueling` | Snapped to nearest fuel station | Nearest petrol bunk |
| `in-transit` | Free movement along OSRM graph | Active destination |

## Optimal Routing Model

When an agent is initialized or rerouted, the engine evaluates all candidate route alternatives returned by the OSRM service. Each route is scored through a composite penalty function:

$$W(R) = \sum_{j=1}^{m} D(N_{j-1}, N_j) + \beta \sum_{k=1}^{n} I(O_k, R) + \gamma \sum_{c=1}^{q} C(Z_c, R)$$

Where:

- $D(N_{j-1}, N_j)$ is the travel duration between adjacent waypoints.
- $I(O_k, R)$ is the incident penalty for route $R$ passing within 500 m of incident $O_k$.
- $C(Z_c, R)$ is the congestion zone penalty for route $R$ entering zone $Z_c$ of severity $\ge$ High.
- $\beta, \gamma$ are tunable severity weights.

The route with the minimum $W(R)$ is selected and its waypoints persisted to the vehicle's `current_route_json` column.

```mermaid

    ALT --> SCORE[Score Each Route via W-R]

    CONGESTION --> SUM
    SUM --> SELECT[Select argmin W-R]
    SELECT --> PERSIST[Store Waypoints in DB]
    PERSIST --> ADVANCE([Begin Positional Tick Loop])
```

## Traffic Congestion Model

Congestion levels for spatial zones are computed dynamically on each simulation tick. The base congestion is derived from time-block historical data (Morning, Noon, Daytime, Midnight), drawn from the Bangalore district traffic dataset. A stochastic noise term and vehicle density contribution are applied:

$$\text{Congestion}(Z, t) = \text{Base}(Z, t) + \delta \cdot \text{VehicleDensity}(Z) + \epsilon$$

Where:

- $\text{Base}(Z, t) \in \{25, 55, 85\}$ corresponds to Low, Medium, and High historical congestion classes.
- $\delta = 2$ is the per-vehicle congestion contribution weight within zone radius $\le 0.01$ degrees (~1 km).
- $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{U}(-4, 4)$ is a continuous uniform noise term providing temporal liveness.

The final computed value is clamped to $[10, 100]$ and persisted per zone.

## Warehouse and Facility Topology

All fleet maintenance and idle vehicles are geospatially anchored to the nearest registered logistics hub. The nearest facility is resolved via Euclidean proxy distance in degree-space:

$$\hat{F} = \arg\min_{F_i \in \mathcal{F}} \sqrt{(\phi - \phi_i)^2 + (\lambda - \lambda_i)^2}$$

This approximation is valid for small offsets within a single metropolitan region. For cross-region accuracy, the full Haversine formulation is applied:

$$d(p, F_i) = 2R \arcsin\left(\sqrt{\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\phi_i - \phi}{2}\right) + \cos\phi\cos\phi_i\sin^2\!\left(\frac{\lambda_i - \lambda}{2}\right)}\right)$$
