## 🚦 Test the Traffic System

Run this to verify traffic works:
```bash
npm run test:traffic
```

Expected output:
- ✅ Incidents spawning based on time/weather
- ✅ Zone congestion calculations
- ✅ Rush hour effects (2.5x more incidents)
- ✅ Weather effects (3.5x for heavy rain)
- ✅ Night time (faster speeds)

## 🏃 Run the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done already)
npm install

# Initialize database
npm run db:setup

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## 📋 API Endpoints Ready

### Create Vehicle
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/vehicles \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My First Truck",
    "type": "truck",
    "sourceLat": 12.9716,
    "sourceLng": 77.5946,
    "destLat": 13.0358,
    "destLng": 77.5970,
    "aiPersonality": "balanced"
  }'
```

### Check Traffic (FREE UNLIMITED)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/traffic
```

### Check Weather (Live Bangalore)
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/weather
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

| Service | Cost | Limits |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Traffic** | **$0** | **NONE** |
| **Weather** | $0 | 60 calls/min (plenty!) |
| **OpenRouter** | Varies | Check your plan |

**Total monthly cost: $0-5** (depending on OpenRouter usage)

## 🎨 What Makes It "Real"

### Traffic Simulation Features:
1. **12 Bangalore Hotspots**
   - Silk Board, Hebbal, Marathahalli, etc.
   - Probability-weighted incident placement

2. **Time Patterns**
   - Rush hours: 7-10 AM, 5-8 PM (2.5x incidents)
   - Night: 10 PM-5 AM (30% faster speeds)
   - Weekday vs weekend differences

3. **Weather Correlation**
   - Clear → normal traffic
   - Rain → 2x incidents, 20% slower
   - Heavy rain → 3.5x incidents, 50% slower
   - Storm → 4x incidents, 60% slower

4. **Incident Types**
   - Accidents (severity-based delays)
   - Breakdowns
   - Roadwork
   - Weather-related
   - Congestion

5. **Smart Zone Calculations**
   - Base speed: 40 km/h
   - Modified by time, weather, incidents
   - Silk Board always more congested
   - Tech hubs worse during rush hour

## 🧠 AI Agent Intelligence

Your AI agents now:
- ✅ Calculate optimal routes with Dijkstra
- ✅ See real-time traffic incidents
- ✅ Feel live weather conditions
- ✅ Imagine being in traffic (first-person)
- ✅ Make human-like decisions

Example AI prompt includes:
```
🚛 YOU ARE THE DRIVER of this truck

🌦️ WEATHER: Heavy rain, 24°C, 2000m visibility
   Speed Impact: 50% slower

🛣️ YOUR CALCULATED ROUTE:
   Distance: 15.2 km
   Time: 28 minutes
   Fuel cost: ₹320
   Incidents on route: 2

🚦 NEARBY ZONES:
   - Silk Board: 85% congestion, avg 12 km/h

⚠️ ACTIVE INCIDENTS:
   1. Accident [high] - Vehicle collision at Outer Ring Road
      Delay: 18 minutes

🤔 IMAGINE YOURSELF:
You are sitting in the driver's seat, feeling the rain pound on the windshield.
Visibility is poor. Traffic is barely moving ahead...

What do YOU decide to do RIGHT NOW?
```

## 📊 Verification Checklist

Before you start, verify:
- [ ] `.env` file exists with OpenWeather key
- [ ] `npm install` completed successfully
- [ ] `npm run test:traffic` shows incidents spawning
- [ ] Database initialized (`npm run db:setup`)

## 🐛 If Something's Wrong

**"Weather API error"**
- Check if OpenWeather key is correct: `b84effb2fc1deaf8c69dae97a22caa5d`
- System will fall back to simulated weather if needed

**"No traffic incidents"**
- This is NORMAL! Incidents spawn probabilistically
- Run `npm run test:traffic` multiple times to see variation
- Try different conditions (rush hour, storm) for more incidents

**"Can't create vehicle"**
- Ensure database is initialized: `npm run db:setup`
- Check coordinates are in Bangalore bounds

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Frontend Development** (pending)
   - Vehicle creation form UI
   - Traffic overlay on map
   - AI thinking visualization
   - Route display

2. **Testing**
   - Create your first vehicle via API
   - Watch AI make decisions
   - Monitor traffic patterns
   - Check route optimization

3. **Customization**
   - Add more Bangalore hotspots
   - Tune incident probabilities
   - Adjust weather effects
   - Create custom AI personalities
